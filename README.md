# Learning React

I am learning react by doing simple exercises and making copious comments on the way on the code I am using.
This is to allow me to understand and reference this project in the future if I 
am puzzled as to how something works.

At the moment the project consists of Hello World being rendered on a webpage.
However, with every day this project will grow and I intend to continue to update
this README as that happens.
