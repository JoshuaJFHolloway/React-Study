# Learning React

I am learning react by doing simple exercises and making copious comments on the way on the code I am using.
This is to allow me to understand and reference this project in the future if I 
am puzzled as to how something works.

At the moment the project consists of Hello World being rendered on a webpage.
However, with every day this project will grow and I intend to continue to update
this README as that happens.


## Update 1- JoshBook

Using the react skills I have been learning I have created a simple avatar profile
of myself in my fictional social media site... JoshBook. Check out the folder named
JoshBook for this wonderful glimpse into the big new social media craze...
